To test out this project with the database, there are several steps, listed below:
1. Get the credentials to the heroku repo.
2. Use the command: export DATABASE_URL='myHerokuCrednetials'
3. Make sure to run the migrateDatabase.sh script, if your database hasn't been setup based on the models.py.
3.5 If the above doesn't work, uncomment the create database line in __init__ of the app module, for the first run only.
4. Now you can run locally, connected to the heroku database.
