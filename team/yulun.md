My name is Yu Lun Chan. i'm 28, and i'm a third year student. I served in the US Navy for 4 years, and i went back to school after that.
My knowledge in CS is extremely rusty and i don't retain much knowledge from college. I will try my best in this class and make the best out of it.
nice to meet you all!
