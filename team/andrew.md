Hello, my name is Andrew. I'm a third year CS student, and I'm very excited about this project.
For this project, the basic structure should be a webapp, with mobile support, on which people can lookup room availibility. 
The project should consist of two main parts, one of which is a scraper and database builder, which builds a database basecd on
current class schedules. The other part is the webapp itself, which provides users with a way of interfacing with the databse
in a user friendly manner.

We are planning on using Python to create this project, and translating the CS56 Java project from Spring-Boot to a python equivilant.
