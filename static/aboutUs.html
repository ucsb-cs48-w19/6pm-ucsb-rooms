			We're a small team students based at UCSB, who want to help you find your classes quickly.<br>
			With the power of this search engine, look for any classroom by entering the building<br>
			number and the room number, and check out it's schedule. That way, you can see if <br>
			it's free and open to study in. Long term this project is looking to expand to find<br>
			new ways to help students plan and schedule.<br>
			<br>Stay tuned for more updates!<br>
